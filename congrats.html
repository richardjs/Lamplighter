			a light began to shine.</span> Dim at first, it quickly grew in intensity
			until it became blinding. The lamps exploded in fire, and in an instant,
			the darkness was gone.</p>

			<p>After living in darkness for so long, the light was almost unbearable.
			However, people are meant to live in the light, and soon the memory of the
			time of darkness begins fading. Warmth soothes the wounds of the past, and
			there are no shadows to dim the future.</p>

			<p>And the seven lamps continue to burn brightly.</p>
